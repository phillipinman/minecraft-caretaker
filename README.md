# Minecraft Caretaker Script

Warning: WIP

Written in Powershell this script aims to automate the most common tasks in an easy, repeatable way.

The main goal is to see how simplified Minecraft administration can be as opposed to a full Docker + VM + Custom Stack.

As this was written in Powershell Core it should work fine on Linux but it's not extensively tested.
